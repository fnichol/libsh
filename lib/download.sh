# Downloads the contents at the given URL to the given local file.
#
# This implementation attempts to use the `curl` program with a fallback to the
# `wget` program and a final fallback to the `ftp` program. The first download
# program to succeed is used and if all fail, this function returns a non-zero
# code.
#
# * `@param [String]` download URL
# * `@param [String]` destination file
# * `@return 0` if a download was successful
# * `@return 1` if a download was not successful
#
# # Notes
#
# At least one of `curl`, `wget`, or `ftp` must be compiled with SSL/TLS
# support to be able to download from `https` sources.
#
# # Examples
#
# Basic usage:
#
# ```sh
# download http://example.com/file.txt /tmp/file.txt
# ```
